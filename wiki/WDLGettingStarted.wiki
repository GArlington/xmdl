#summary Getting Started with WDL
#labels Phase-Support,WDL

== Introduction ==

This page is a step-by-step guide to get started with WDL. It is intended to demonstrate how to start with a new project, and generate source code.

== Requirements == 

This guide is intended to be functional with the following configuration of software versions:
 * [http://maven.apache.org/ Maven 2.0.7] 
 * [http://xtext.itemis.com/ Eclipse 3.5 (Galileo) + TMF Xtext 0.7.2] *optional*
 
 _Even though eclipse is not required to generate code with WDL, it is recomended to be used for model file editing. The WDL editor embedded in Eclipse, performs dynamic syntax checking which may reduce errors in modeling phase. _

== Creating Project ==

 * Create an empty directory:
 {{{
 mkdir sample
 cd sample
 }}}
 * Use the maven archetype to create project structure:
 {{{
 mvn archetype:create \
 -DgroupId=com.example \
 -DartifactId=sample \
 -DarchetypeGroupId=org.xmdl.wdl.gen \
 -DarchetypeArtifactId=org.xmdl.wdl.ida-archetype \
 -DarchetypeVersion=0.1.0 \
 -DremoteRepositories=http://xmdl.googlecode.com/svn/branches/release-0.7/repository
 }}}

== Code Generation ==
 * Go into the project directory (sample/sample/):
 {{{
 cd sample
 }}}
 * Generate source code and run unit tests:
 {{{
mvn hsql:start test -Pgenerate 
 }}}
*hsql:start* parameter runs a local HSQL server to perform unit tests,
*-Pgenerate* initiates code generation. If you do not perform this parameter, code generation will not be performed during maven build process.
