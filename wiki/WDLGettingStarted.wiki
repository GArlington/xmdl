#summary Getting Started with WDL
#labels Phase-Support, WDL

== Introduction ==

This page is a step-by-step guide to get started with WDL. It is intended to demonstrate how to start with a new project, and generate source code.

== Requirements == 

This guide is intended to be functional with the following configuration of software versions:
 * [http://maven.apache.org/ Maven 2.0.7] 
 * [http://xtext.itemis.com/ Eclipse 3.5 (Galileo) + TMF Xtext 0.7.2] *optional*
 
 _Even though eclipse is not required to generate code with WDL, it is recomended to be used for model file editing. The WDL editor embedded in Eclipse, performs dynamic syntax checking which may reduce errors in modeling phase. _

== Installing WDL Generator ==

== Creating Project ==

 * Create an empty directory:
 {{{
 mkdir sample
 cd sample
 }}}
 * Use the maven archetype to create project structure:
 {{{
 mvn archetype:create \
 -DgroupId=com.example \
 -DartifactId=sample \
 -DarchetypeGroupId=org.xmdl.wdl \
 -DarchetypeArtifactId=org.xmdl.wdl.ida-archetype \
 -DarchetypeVersion=0.1 \
 -DremoteRepositories=http://taslak.googlecode.com/svn/repository
